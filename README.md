# VirtualBoxMonitor
Performance monitor of VirtualBox VMs

*** Instructions to compilation and installation ***

This performance monitor is developed and will work as a frontend of VirtualBox. Thus, to compile and use it, 
you need first download the source of Virtualbox. 

Next, copy the source directory here to Frontends/VirtualBox in your VirtualBox source local directory, and then compile 
the entire VirtualBox project. After building the project, run VirtualBox as usual, the performance monitor will pop up when 
you start one or more VMs.
